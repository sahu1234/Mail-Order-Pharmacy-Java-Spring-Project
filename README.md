# Mail-Order-Pharmacy-Java-Spring-Project
A leading Pharmaceutical Benefits Management (PBM) Organization wants to develop a  Mail-Order Pharmacy module using Microservices Mail-order pharmacies operate through your health insurance plan and can be cheaper  and more convenient than getting your medications from a local pharmacy. A mailorder prescription means that you donâ€™t have to pick up your medication from a  pharmacy; instead, it is delivered to your doorstep. There will also be a Member Portal to be developed part of this scope that consumes  these Microservices. The Portal allows its members to subscribe for drugs refill, also to  unsubscribe, etc
